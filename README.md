R portfolio project. Analyzing bicycle rental data.


Cyclistic is a standard and electric bike rental service based in Chicago. Their trip data is publically available.
This is being used as part of a case study for a google data analytics certification. 


## Case Study ##

Cyclistic is looking for marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

I am a Jr analyst that has been given these questions to answer about the data

1. How do members and casuals differ from each other?
2. Is there a 'why' in the data for casual riders to convert?
3. How can marketing be used to highlight the 'why' and influence casuals?
